`pyairvisual` is a simple, clean, well-tested library for interacting with
[AirVisual](https://www.airvisual.com/) to retrieve air quality information.

# PLEASE READ: Version 2.0.0 and Beyond

Version 2.0.0 of `pyairvisual` makes several breaking, but necessary changes:

* Moves the underlying library from
  [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) to
  [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Changes the entire library to use `asyncio`
* Makes 3.6 the minimum version of Python required

If you wish to continue using the previous, synchronous version of
`pyairvisual`, make sure to pin version 1.0.0.

# Python Versions

`pyairvisual` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8

# Installation

```python
pip install pyairvisual
```

# API Key

You can get an AirVisual API key from
[the AirVisual API site](https://www.airvisual.com/user/api). Depending on
the plan you choose, more functionality will be available from the API:

## Community

The Community Plan gives access to:

* List supported countries
* List supported states
* List supported cities
* Get data from the nearest city based on IP address
* Get data from the nearest city based on latitude/longitude
* Get data from a specific city

## Startup

The Startup Plan gives access to:

* List supported stations in a city
* Get data from the nearest station based on IP address
* Get data from the nearest station based on latitude/longitude
* Get data from a specific station

## Enterprise

The Enterprise Plan gives access to:

* Get a global city ranking of air quality

# Usage

`pyairvisual` starts within an
[aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) `ClientSession`:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pyairvisual import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
      # YOUR CODE HERE


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

## Using the Cloud API

Getting data from the AirVisual Cloud API is easy:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pyairvisual import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
        # If an API key isn't provided, only Nodes can be queried; everything else
        # requires an API key:
        client = Client(websession, api_key="<YOUR_AIRVISUAL_API_KEY>")

        # Get data based on the city nearest to your IP address:
        data = await client.data.nearest_city()

        # ...or get data based on the city nearest to a latitude/longitude:
        data = await client.data.nearest_city(
            latitude=39.742599, longitude=-104.9942557)

        # ...or get it explicitly:
        data = await client.data.city(
            city="Los Angeles", state="California", country="USA")

        # If you have the appropriate API key, you can also get data based on
        # station (nearest or explicit):
        data = await client.data.nearest_station()
        data = await client.data.nearest_station(
            latitude=39.742599, longitude=-104.9942557)
        data = await client.data.station(
            station="US Embassy in Beijing",
            city="Beijing",
            state="Beijing",
            country="China")

        # With the appropriate API key, you can get an air quality ranking:
        data = await client.data.ranking()

        # pyairvisual gives you several methods to look locations up:
        countries = await client.supported.countries()
        states = await client.supported.states("USA")
        cities = await client.supported.cities("USA", "Colorado")
        stations = await client.supported.stations("USA", "Colorado", "Denver")


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

## Working with Node/Pro Units

`pyairvisual` also allows users to interact with
[Node/Pro units](https://www.airvisual.com/air-quality-monitor), both via the cloud API:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pyairvisual import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
        client = Client(websession)

        # The Node/Pro unit ID can be retrieved from the "API" section of the cloud
        # dashboard:
        data = await client.node.from_cloud_api("<NODE_ID>")


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

...or over the local network (the unit password can be found on the device itself):

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pyairvisual import Client
from pyairvisual.node import NodeSamba


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
        client = Client(websession)

        # Can take several optional parameters:
        #   1. include_history: include historical measurements (defaults to True)
        #   2. include_trends: include trends (defaults to True)
        #   3. measurements_to_use: the number of measurements to use when calculating
        #      trends (defaults to -1, which means "use all measurements")
        data = await client.node.from_samba(
            "<IP_ADDRESS_OR_HOST>",
            "<PASSWORD>",
            include_history=True,
            include_trends=True,
            measurements_to_use=10,
        )


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```
